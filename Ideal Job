This position is as a Network Systems engineer. In this job I would have to maintain and develop both the software and 
hardware aspects of a large server configuration. I would perform regular checks on servers and software as well as make
any changes and improvements that my employer would want me to.
This job requires a tertiary degree such as a Bachelor of IT to be up to the standards required as well as extensive 
experience in Cisco, VMWare, AWS and Microsoft-based network infrastructure.
I plan to develop these skills by either getting an internship or a lower level job at a networking firm and building
experience, slowly working my way up to this job title over a few years of dedicated work.
