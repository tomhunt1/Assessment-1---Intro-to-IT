These results define me as very introverted, an all-rounder learner as I am almost equal parts auditory, tactile and visual
learner and my greatest strength is curiosity. To me these results mean that I focus much more on learning and discovering
new things instead of focusing on social connections and communication.

These results indicate that I may struggle in a team environment as I am very introverted, and I struggle to share ideas and
communicate well in this situation. However, being an all-rounder learner and having the key character strength of curiosity
will definitely help in me listening and reflecting to other team members ideas which is a benefit.

When forming a team it is important to choose people with different character strengths and personality types so that people
can perform well in the areas they are good at, thus creating a well-rounded team. Having all team members with a similar
learning style is a good idea so that everyone can take in the right information from one mode of communication. For example,
having everyone be an auditory learner will mean that talking is the best mode of communication.
