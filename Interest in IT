I have been interested in IT since I was 3 years old when my parents gave me my first “build your own circuit” kit.
I always preferred to be inside fiddling around with a computer or circuitry or pulling apart an old radio rather than
being outside like everyone else. As I travelled through primary school, whenever there was a problem with a computer the
teachers would pull me out of class to help which is funny because our school had an IT department. I did the sound and
lighting engineering for the entire school from year 5 to year 9 until they hired an adult to do the job who I trained.
I’ve done a fair bit of programming using C++ as well as using Arduino to do many things such as build an automated seed
planting robot and a flight simulator dashboard that linked in directly with Microsoft Flight Simulator. I chose RMIT as
I had heard it was a very high standard university and it was one that I found through Open Universities Australia that
could be completed online. I expect to learn many aspects of IT from this degree such as programming, networking, IT
professionalism and ethics, operating systems and hardware.
